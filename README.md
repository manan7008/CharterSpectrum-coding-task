# CharterSpectrum-coding-task
The project I have made using React for front end and Backend using node.js and MongoDB

#Import restaurantData.json to your mongodb local database.
#Run npm install in restaurant folder and restaurant_api folder
#Run npm start in restaurant folder and restaurant_api folder

#The application should run now



Charter/Spectrum Full Stack Code Challenge
For this challenge we would like you to create a React application and an API that uses
restaurant data from the attached JSON file. The React application should present the data
in a table and allows users to filter that data
User stories:
Backend Tasks:
• Build RESTful/GraphQL webservices to query, sort, search and pagination
restaurant data
• Build data access layer for CRUD operation
• Use JSON file to insert data into a database of your choice
Frontend Tasks:
• A user should be able to see a table with the name, city, state, phone number, and
genres for each restaurant
• A user should see results sorted by name in alphabetical order starting with the
beginning of the alphabet
• A user should be able to filter restaurants by state
• A user should be able to filter by genre
• State and Genre filters should default to “All” and take effect instantaneously (no
additional clicks)
• A user should be able to enter text into a search field. When hitting the enter key
or clicking on a search button, the table should search results. Search results
should match either the name, city, or genre
• A user should be able to clear the search by clearing the text value in the search
input
• A user should only see 10 results at a time and the table should be paginated
• A user should be able to combine filters and search. The user should be able to
turn filters on and off while a search value is present
• If any of the filters do not return any restaurants, the UI should indicate that no
results were found
